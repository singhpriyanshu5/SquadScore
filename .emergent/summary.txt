The AI engineer successfully built a mobile-friendly board game score tracker using Expo, React Native, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with backend API implementation and testing, followed by frontend UI creation and integration. Key challenges included refining the UI for mobile responsiveness and specific user requests (emoji support, clickable tiles, filters), and a prolonged struggle to implement reliable cross-platform file download/upload functionality. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by switching strategies for download (e.g., from  to web APIs, and then to a backend-served file) due to environment constraints and user feedback, consistently prioritizing a native-like user experience and addressing issues promptly. The codebase reflects a commitment to mobile-first design principles.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a mobile-friendly board game score tracker app (preferably iPhone native, responsive web app acceptable).
**Core Flow:**
1.  **Group Management:** Users create a group account, and the owner can invite others.
2.  **Data Entry:** Group members can add player names (or team name + player names), game name (typed or selected from dropdown), date of game, and scores for each session.
3.  **Team Games:** When a score is entered for a team, it should automatically distribute to each player on that team for consistent leaderboards.
4.  **Dashboard:** Display a leaderboard with top players/teams and basic insights (top-scoring players, most played games).

**Enhancements & Iterations:**
*   Game recording flow: 'Custom game' first, then common games sorted by most played.
*   Group home page: Make stat tiles clickable to view lists of players and games.
*   Player management: Add emoji selection for players, displayed next to their names.
*   Player/Game Management: Enable editing and deleting players and deleting game sessions.
*   Leaderboard: Add filters for specific game names or dates/months.
*   Data Management: Add download group history (CSV) and upload group history (CSV) buttons to the group dashboard for backup/restore.

**Requirements:** Fully functional front-end and back-end, shareable, simple and intuitive mobile UI.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack:** Expo (React Native frontend), FastAPI (Python backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Mobile UI/UX:**  for file-based navigation,  for styling,  for input.
-   **State Management:** , ,  hooks.
-   **API Communication:**  for HTTP requests.
-   **Data Serialization:** CSV for import/export, JSON for API.
-   **File Handling:** ,  (initially), direct web APIs for download/upload.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture:
-   **Frontend (Expo/React Native)**: Located in , responsible for the mobile UI and interacting with the backend API. Uses  for file-based navigation.
-   **Backend (FastAPI)**: Located in , handles API requests, business logic, and database interactions with MongoDB.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Contains all FastAPI routes for group, player, team, game, and session management. It includes CRUD operations, leaderboard generation, and specific endpoints for filtering, data export, and import.
    -   **Changes:** Initially defined core APIs. Later extended with endpoints for player edit/delete, game session delete, filtered leaderboards, unique game names, and dedicated  and  routes, with the  route updated to serve files directly.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Defines the main navigation structure using 's stack navigator. It sets up the app's overall layout and accessible routes.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to include new routes like  and ensure proper screen transitions.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** The initial screen users see upon opening the app, providing options to Create New Group or Join Existing Group.
    -   **Changes:** Initial implementation focused on basic group entry.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Screen for users to join an existing group using a group code.
    -   **Changes:** Initial creation.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** The main group dashboard. Displays group statistics (players, games), navigation to other group-specific screens, and includes the Download Group History and Upload Group History buttons.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to make stat tiles clickable, and repeatedly modified to implement robust cross-platform download/upload functionality using , , and finally, a direct backend file serving approach for download to resolve environment-specific errors ( deprecation, ,  object errors).
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Manages players within a group, allowing viewing, adding, editing (name, emoji), and deleting players.
    -   **Changes:** Implemented player emoji selection, added edit/delete functionality, and underwent multiple UI/layout adjustments to prevent text overlap, especially for average scores. Player card size and icon sizes were modified multiple times. The emoji was moved from right to left.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Screen for recording new game sessions, including selecting game name, players/teams, and scores.
    -   **Changes:** Modified to prioritize 'custom game' input and dynamically sort game options by popularity/most played.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Displays the leaderboard for players and teams within the group, showing rankings and scores.
    -   **Changes:** Added filtering options by game name and date/month, requiring new UI components (modal, dropdowns) and integration with new backend filter endpoints. Layout was adjusted for the filter button.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Displays the history of all recorded game sessions for the group.
    -   **Changes:** Initial creation as a clickable tile target from the dashboard. Implemented game session deletion and underwent UI fixes to resolve crashes and ensure proper rendering of game session details with delete buttons.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the frontend integration for the Upload Group History functionality, ensuring it correctly sends the CSV file to the backend's  endpoint.
-   Thoroughly test the Download Group History functionality to confirm it correctly downloads a CSV file directly, now that the backend endpoint is ready.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving persistent issues with the Download Group History button. The previous attempts to handle downloads using frontend-specific APIs (like  and direct web  manipulation) resulted in various errors (, , , ).

The current strategy involves a fundamental shift: instead of trying to generate and download the file purely on the frontend, the backend will now serve the file directly. The AI engineer has just successfully added a new endpoint, , to the  file, which is intended to serve the CSV data for direct download.

The next immediate step is to update the frontend code in  to call this new backend endpoint when the Download Group History button is clicked, simplifying the frontend's role to merely initiating the API request, which will trigger a file download from the server.
